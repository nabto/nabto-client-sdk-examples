# nabto-client-sdk-releases

This repo replaces the [Nabto5-releases](https://github.com/nabto/nabto5-releases) repo for releases of the Nabto Client SDK library from v5.12.0. Earlier releases are still available in the original repo.

This repo only has a single set of artifacts checked in. When a Nabto Client SDK library is released, the artifacts in this repo will be updated, and the repo will be tagged for the particular release.

The latest release artifacts can always be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/nabto/nabto-client-sdk-releases/releases/latest).
